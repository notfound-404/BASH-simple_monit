# BASH-simple_monit


As I said in May 2016 (yes, it's been a long time), here is the code of my monitoring tool, written in BASH.

This tool was created to have fun with Metal3d's simple_curses :
https://github.com/metal3d/bashsimplecurses

Of course, it is not intended to be a real monitoring tool, because it is not intended to be. 
But if you have not very important machines, or already monitored but you want a click display, then this trick is for you ! :)

Have fun.
